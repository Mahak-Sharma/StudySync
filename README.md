## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
- **Styling:** Traditional CSS (no frameworks), Google Fonts (Poppins), Responsive Design
- **Icons:** react-icons

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) - [Download here](https://python.org/)
- **pip** (Python package manager, usually comes with Python)

### Quick Start (Complete Stack - Frontend + Both Backends)

**Option 1: Using npm script (Recommended)**
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

**Option 2: Using the startup script directly**
```sh
npm install
node start-dev.js
```

**Option 3: Using platform-specific scripts**
- **Windows:** Double-click `start.bat` or run `start.bat` in Command Prompt
- **Mac/Linux:** Run `./start.sh` in Terminal (make sure it's executable: `chmod +x start.sh`)

### What This Does
The startup script will:
1. ✅ Check if Node.js and Python are installed
2. 📦 Install npm dependencies (if not already installed)
3. 🐍 Install Python dependencies for the backend
4. 👥 Start the friends backend (Node.js/Express API on port 5000)
5. 📄 Start the summarization backend (Python/Flask API on port 5001)
6. 🎨 Start the React frontend (Vite dev server on port 5173)

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **No File Storage:** Uploaded files are processed in memory and never saved to disk
- **Instant Processing:** Files are summarized immediately and then discarded
- **Privacy First:** Your documents remain private and aren't stored on the server

### Access Your Application
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Friends Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (User management, friends, groups)
- **Summarization Backend API:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) (File processing, summaries)

### Manual Start (Individual Services)
If you prefer to start services individually:

1. **Frontend only:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Friends Backend only (Node.js):**
   ```sh
   cd src/api
   node friendsBackend.js
   ```

3. **Summarization Backend only (Python):**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python summarize_api.py
   ```

### 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)
If you have an existing `backend/uploads` folder from the old version, you can clean it up:
```sh
python cleanup-uploads.py
```
This removes the old uploads folder since files are now processed in memory.
